== Optimized variants of `stdenv`

For the optimizations there's barely an on-size-fits-all option.

In "_helper/stdenvs.nix_" there are some pre-defined variantes we can mix-and-match the packages from.

=== `stendvs.upstream` for hitting the cache

Use this `stdenv` for packages you want to be picked from the official caches - i.e. don't want
to rebuild yourself

=== `stendvs.safeTweaks` for safe optimization

These packages need to be recompiled for your system.

It enables optimizations which are typically safe ot do like `-O3`, `-march`, `-mtune` etc.

=== `stendvs.withLto`

Enabling link-time-optimizations will break several packages. It can be beneficial for selected packages, though.

=== `stendvs.withAggressiveFastMath`

Doing fast-math will only have an impact on a few packages. Enabling it globally would easily break stuff
