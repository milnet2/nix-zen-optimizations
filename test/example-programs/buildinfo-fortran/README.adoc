== Buildinfo Program

This is a simple Fortran program that prints build information in JSON format to stdout.
It's useful for assessing if Nix picked up compiler optimizations.

=== Building with Nix

[source,bash]
----
nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}'
./result/bin/buildinfo-cpp
----

=== Using Optimized Nix (with Zen optimizations)

To build the program with the optimized Nix setup from this repository:

[source,bash]
----
nix-build -E 'with import ./../../../zen-optimized-pkgs.nix {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}'
./result/bin/buildinfo-cpp
----
