== Example programs for verifying optimizations

In the subfolders there are example programs written in various languages.

=== Programs "_buildinfo-*_"

The programs "_buildinfo-*_" try to access compiler information and optimizations at runtime of the specific program.
They output Json to stdout which is later interpreted by tests.

The programs are also used by the test-suite in the root-folder.

To execute them *unoptimized* on your system you can run:

[source,shell]
----
cd buildinfo-* # TODO: Pick your language
nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}'
./result/bin/buildinfo
----

You can compare the output to their individual outputs *with optimizations* as generated through:

[source,shell]
----
cd buildinfo-* # TODO: Pick your language
nix-build -E 'with import ./../../../zen-optimized-pkgs.nix {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}'
./result/bin/buildinfo
----
