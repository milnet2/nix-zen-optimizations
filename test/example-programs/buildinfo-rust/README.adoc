= Rust Build Information Program

This program prints information about the Rust compiler, build environment, and target architecture in JSON format.

== Purpose

The primary purpose of this program is to verify that compiler optimizations are working correctly, especially SIMD instruction sets like AVX and SSE.

== Building with Nix

[source,bash]
----
nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}'
./result/bin/buildinfo
----

=== Using Optimized Nix (with Zen optimizations)

To build the program with the optimized Nix setup from this repository:

[source,bash]
----
nix-build -E 'with import ./../../../zen-optimized-pkgs.nix {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}'
./result/bin/buildinfo
----
