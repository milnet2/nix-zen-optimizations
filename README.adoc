== Compile programs optimized for Zen using nix

Contains facilities for installing programs on https://nixos.org/[Nix-based] *Linux* systems with an AMD Ryzen CPU.

----
⚠⚠⚠ The repo is currently *mostly broken* ⚠⚠⚠
----

The intended use of it is through an "alternative" `pkgs` from the system like:

[source,nix]
----
# Where this would be your regular one
pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};

# There can be an additional
pkgsTuned = import ./zen-optimized-pkgs.nix {
    inherit  lib;
    importablePkgsDelegate = <nixpkgs>;
    amdZenVersion = 2;
    ltoLevel = "thin"; };
----

The mechanism tries to use the (unoptimized) compilers present on the system and create optimized binaries from the packages to install.

CAUTION:: I'm no expert in this so the approaches may be unorthodox or not work properly.
    I've added some tests which seem to work, though.

=== Covered languages

The implementation covers the following languages:

|===
|Language |Mechanism |Status

| C                     | Wrapper-script around system `gcc`        a|
* [yellow]#⚠# Not all optimizations applied properly
* ✅ tests pass - #double check#
| C++                   | Wrapper-script around system `gcc`        a|
* [yellow]#⚠# Not all optimizations applied properly
* ✅ tests pass - #double check#
| Go                    |                                           | ❌ #Compile error#, tests disabled
| Rust                  | Wrapper-script around system `rustc` and `cargo` a|
* ✅ tests pass
| Python 3 (minimal)    | Interpreter compiled with optimizations   a|
* [yellow]#⚠# Should prefer local build because of optimizations
* ✅ tests pass
* [yellow]#⚠# Tests should be more specific on optimizations
| Fortran               | Wrapper-script around system `gfortran`   a|
* ✅ tests pass
| Haskell               | Wrapped system `ghc` but recompiled with LLVM support a|
* [yellow]#⚠# Test's don't really test anything
| Julia                 |                                           | ❌ #Compile error#, tests disabled
| R                     | Recompiled interpreter                    a|
* ✅ Use Zen-optimized _BLAS_ and _LAPACK_
* [yellow]#⚠# Many optimizations not applied to interpreter (compile error)
* [yellow]#⚠# Test's don't really test anything
* ❌ Nix `checkPhase` is disabled due to regressions
| Zig                   |                                           | ❌ #Compile error#, #test is bullshit#

=== Picked libraries

The implementation use the following libraries:

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|Library |Mechanism |Status

| blas                  | provided through https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-25.05/pkgs/by-name/am/amd-blis/package.nix[amd-blis]                   a|
* Used by
** _R_
* Set to proper Zen-version
* Uses unoptimized "parent" `CC`
| lapack                | provided through https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-25.05/pkgs/by-name/am/amd-libflame/package.nix[amd-libflame]           a|
* Used by
** _R_
* Uses optimized `CC` from above
|===

=== Open work

* Properly use `lto`
* Use the _ROCM_ packages
** See also: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/60a2d618f68142e2e697a7cec22c33212751d73a/pkgs/development/rocm-modules/6/llvm/default.nix#L182
* OpenMP - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/79818
* _gcc_ (and _binutils_) still seems to be built once I use Python :(
* Use AMD BLIS/LIBFLAME (optimized for modern AMD x86_64 CPUs) everywhere (not only _R_)
* Set default-args to the Python interpreter - like `-OO` `-X no_debug_ranges`
* Don't build the bootstrap-packages
* https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock
* Optimize `jdk`

=== Run tests

Tests compile simple programs (xref:test/example-programs/README.adoc[]) in the individual languages and inspect their output.
To execute all the tests run:

[source,shell]
----
nix run --no-write-lock-file github:nix-community/nix-unit -- ./zen-optimized-pkgs.test.nix
----
